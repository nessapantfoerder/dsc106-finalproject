  What have you done so far?
  <br /><br />
  So far, we have set up the blueprint of the webpage. We created 3 slides; one for 
  linear regression, one for logistic regression, and one for the conclusion. We used 
  the linearregression from simple-statistics to fit a linear regression model to the
  simulated data. In addition, we are working on using logistic-regression from the same 
  package to fit a logistic regression model to the simulated data. Then, we added a 
  button to add an outlier, as well as a buttion to remove outliers, so that we can 
  show how outliers affect linear regression and logistic regression. The prototype has 
  3 visualizations and 2 interative buttons.

  What will be the most challenging of your project to design and why?
  <br /><br />
  The most challenging part of our project to design will be the logistic regression model. 
  This is because logistic regression is a more complex model than linear regression. It 
  is also more difficult to interpret the results of logistic regression than linear 
  regression. Regarding the linear regression model, there is the challenge of updating 
  the linear regression model with the addition/removal of points simultaneously. We may 
  add a button to fit the new data to oveercome that difficulty.
